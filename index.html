        <p>Regardless of their level, a football player's kit is about confidence as much as it's about performance. From junior to professional, it's your amour from self-doubt. A reminder that no matter where you are in the journey "from grassroots to greatness," you belong there. And yet, this critical step in preparing the team's next season has been surprisingly traditional.</p>

        <h5>Turning athletes into designers<h5>
        <p>The process began with one representative from the team meeting with a retailer armed with notes from players and management. This customer then explains what they are looking for, pointing to samples that are not quite right while flipping through a pile of catalogs the retailer offers. Hopefully, one of them is Nike.</p>

            <h5>Moving away from the hassle of paper catalogues</h5>
            <p>These clients had a clear idea of what they wanted but had no accurate way to capture and communicate it. To make matters worse, there were numerous ways their design could be misinterpreted. Teams would verbally describe how they wanted their kits to look and hoped that every person in the assembly chain would understand. Catalogue photography struggled to capture how material genuinely looked, leading to misaligned expectations for the final product. In the end, XX% of orders that did make it to Nike was returned for not matching the desired result.</p>

            <h5>Developing a powerful 3D tool</h5>
            <p>A software solution powerful enough to enable players and coaches to become designers, yet light enough to run from niketeamfootball.com, would be the single solution to a list of problems. With a simplified customer-facing kit experience, we skipped photography and its limitations to embrace 3D models. We required 3D models so precise that you could almost touch the material to avoid new wave returns.<br><br>In our search for the right partner, we met Smoke & Mirrors, specialists in scanning 3D fabrics. With a rig of 180 cameras capturing hi-res data where each final article of clothing, from shirts to socks, contained more than 2Gb. This method allowed for creating digital twins of Nike's materials, delivered in layers that enabled exceptionally flexible customization.</p>

            <h5>A solution build to scale that creates digital twins</h5>
            <p>With 40 individual colours, 20 unique jersey designs, we have given clients the power to control every variable. Adding up model choice, colour combination, and material selection provides thousands of options before you even get to team and sponsor logos with player names. Client accounts allow the designated designer to share the results with every team member before approaching a retailer. Consequently, the true-to-life renders dramatically reduced returns by a projected XX%. Likewise, it significantly reduced the workflow, removing the need to photograph every colour.  <br><br>For retailers, players and teams, it provides them with the latest Nike sport innovations and information. The simplified experience secures trust that players will receive precisely the kits they design. The signature Nike style for visuals means the kit configurator generates striking design assets that are applied throughout the customer journey—in social, shop experience, order confirmation and even aftercare.</p>
